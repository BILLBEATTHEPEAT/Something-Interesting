When using a single key which is at least as large as the plaintext,
it will be less possible for people who has intercepted the ciphertext
to use the frequency analysis to do the decipher thing. Since the key
will not be repeatwhile encrypting, we cannot simplify the decrypting
process into decrypting Caesar Cipher by putting the letters enciphered
by the same key letter together. To ensure this the randomness of the
key should be necessary. The substring of the key should not be repeated
regularly.
