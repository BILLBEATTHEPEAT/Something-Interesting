This fold contains the practices I did when learning the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).  

Many of them are **NOT** original. That means I have copied a lot from the other awsome Githubers.

However, I have done some interesting overwrite/modificationï¼Œwith comments like "# I have done XXX here", in the code.

I am not as skillful as the original authors, but running, tuning and modifying their codes are good practice for me.

**Thanks for their work!**

P.S. I have stared your code!
