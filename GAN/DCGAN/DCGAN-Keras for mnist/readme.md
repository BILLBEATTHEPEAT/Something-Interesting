This is a modified copy from the code in [https://github.com/yashk2810/DCGAN-Keras](https://github.com/yashk2810/DCGAN-Keras)

The code is a implementation of the DCGAN with Keras in Jupyter Notebook.
- Scaled input into [-1,1].
- Applying LeakyReLu with alpha of 0.2 as the activation function.
- Instead of Max-pooling, strided convolutions are used in the discri.
- I have saved the model after specific epoches and upload the models with the .ipynb.
- The output of each model has shown in the .ipynb file.

**Thanks for the work of [Yash Katariya](https://github.com/yashk2810)!**
